# Class 2 - Intro To Java  

## Learning Objectives  
* Students should have a fundamental understanding of the basics of JAVA including:  
  * Collection Types

## Lab Assignment  
* Create a new Java file called `CollectionTypes.java`.  
* Define your `CollectionTypes` class as public.  
* Implement the required `main(String[] args)` method as a `public` and `static` method.  
* Write a function that takes in an ArrayList of 5 planet names as Strings, checks if the ArrayList contains “Earth". If it does not, add it and return the new ArrayList. Otherwise, return the original List.
* Write another function that takes in the above ArrayList, and, using a TreeSet, sorts the List alphabetically and removes any duplicates. Example Output: `[“Venus", "Venus", "Mars", “Earth"]` would produce `[“Earth","Mars",“Venus"]`.
* Declare a HashMap with String keys, and String values. Be creative. Then, declare a function that takes in a String and HashMap, and searches the HashMap for the given String as a value. Return a Boolean representing whether the value was found or not.
* Write a function that counts repeating words in an ArrayList of Strings, and prints out the count of each.
