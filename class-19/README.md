## Project Planning Stage  
There is a PDF that your team should print and use as a resource for the preparation of project week.  
[Project Prep Doc](PresentationPrephandout.pdf)  

> Your project plan document must be uploaded, via a canvas submission, by 1 designated member of your group. Some stuff scribbled on a whiteboard, or a photo of some stuff scribbled on a whiteboard, is not sufficient.  

The **Project Plan** document should contain the following information:  
* Your team's name (if you want one)  
* Your team's members names  
* Your project's overview and concept  
* A diagram or overview of your project's model layer  
* Sketches/wireframes of your project's pages  
* Any Frameworks and Libraries you foresee needing  
* A detailed overview of the features needed to meet MVP(Minimum Viable Product)  
* A detailed overview of the stretch goals you want to implement given a completed MVP.  
* Which task management system will you use for tracking feature implementation?(GitHub Projects, Trello, Waffle.io, etc.)  

> NOTE: You should not be writing any code prior to first thing Monday morning.
