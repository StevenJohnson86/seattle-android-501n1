# Class 1 - Intro To Java  

## Learning Objectives  
* Students should have a fundamental understanding of the basics of JAVA including:  
  * Variables & Constants  
  * Numeric Types & Operations  
  * Strings  
  * Decisions  
  * Repeating Steps  
  * Methods  

## Lab Assignment  
* Get system configured to support writing command-line Java.  
* Create a new Java file called `HelloWorld.java`.  
* Define your `HelloWorld` class as public.  
* Implement the required `main(String[] args)` method as a `public` and `static` method.  
* Write a method that takes an `int` parameter uses `System.out` to print it to the console.  
* Write a method that takes in 2 `String` parameters and returns them concatenated together as a `String`(with extra no spaces).  
* Write a method that takes in a `String`, and returns a `String` in the following format:
  * return `String`: “String contains *n* characters”.  
* Write a method that takes in a `String` and reverses it.  
  * HINT: You COULD use a loop to iterate over the characters in the original String.

- In the "Filename including extension..." field put 'HelloWorld.java'.  
- Copy-paste your code from your `HelloWorld.java` into the big input field for the Gist.  
- Select the button that says "Create secret gist"; copy that link for submission in the Canvas assignment.
